        <h3><strong>Module 2: The Internet.</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Module 2 goes over how the internet, encryption and encoding works.
        </p>
        <h5>Encoding:</h5>
        <p>
          Encoding is the process of translating bits into legible termns that
          humans can understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encoding uses a few basic languages to help programmers communicate
          with a computer program:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <h6>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):</h6>
          <p>
            The most basic form of encoding, it is the language used to help
            people reaad code. Each ASCII digit is a four bytes, and can
            represent every letter, symbol and number in the US and UK english
            alphabet. The system works by runnign a best out of
          </p>
          <h6>RGB (Red Green Blue):</h6>
          <p>
            A basic language used to represent colors by mixing Red, Green and
            Blue from varying brightness levels. It starts at 0, being the
            darkest, black or nothing, and ending at 255, being brightest and/or
            full color strength. An example of RGB would be shown as (255, 255,
            255) the first number being Red and the last being Blue.
          </p>
          <h6>Hex (Hexidecimal):</h6>
          <p>
            Another language similar to ASCII but more in depth. It's primarily
            used in conjunction with RGB to depict specific colors in a more
            technical manner.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Encryption:</h5>
        <p>
          Encryption is the process of hiding information and data behind a
          cypher before to protect it from being red by an unintended third
          party.
        </p>
        <p>
          In simpler terms, Encryption is done to hide infomation from other
          people. Like hiding messages between two people.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the encryption process, the two clients are given a key to the
          encryption, this key not only acts as their proof of legitimacy but
          also allows their devices to understand the encrypted information they
          will recieve or send.
        </p>
        <p>Encryption is usually handled in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <h6>Symmetric:</h6>
          <p>
            Used in more private connections such as private messaging, Company
            systems, etc. In Symmectric Encryption, two clients are given the
            same key to the encryption. This system is much faster as encryption
            and decryption systems don't spend time making new decryption keys
            and encryption systems.
          </p>
          <h6>Asymmetric:</h6>
          <p>
            This system is more commonly used for public connections such as
            online services but can also be private. It's designed to give each
            client a randomly generated decryption key and randomize the
            Encryption each time, ensuring more safety at the cost of being
            slower than its counterpart.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <h5>Decryption:</h5>
        <p>
          Decryption is the process in which a device translates the encrypted
          data into usable information.
